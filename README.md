# Handwritten-Text-Recognition-HCI
Recognition of handwritten and machine characters is an emerging area of research and finds extensive applications everywhere. Our application accepts an image/document in the form of a .png extension and pre-processes the manually written text to neatly segment it into parts. After segmentation, the recognition of simple isolated characters or strokes helps us to translate the human handwritten text to give an output in the form of digital text and audio that reads the text present in the image uploaded
