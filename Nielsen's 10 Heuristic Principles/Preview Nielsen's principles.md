# Applying 'Nielsen's 10 Heuristic Principles' to our Handwritten Text Recognition application, we verify and check if the our interface follows some basic guidelines (7/10 is the pass benchmark)

## 1. Visibility of system status: By keeping the users informed whether they have uploaded the right file by displaying the image after adding the image.
## 2. Match between system and real word: The system gives simple english command options which are easy to understand and these help the user to interact with the system effectively.
## 3. User control: The user is allowed to undo their actions. The user can override the uploaded image with a new image if they want to upload another image.
## 4. Error prevent: If the user presses recognise button without uploading the image, it will be shown that the image is not uploaded. If the user presses the train option without uploading the image, image not uploaded message is shown.
## 5. Help users recover from their errors: if the user uploads a wrong file type ,they are allowed to put the correct file type again in the upload section.
## 6. Consistency and standards: The options are provided clearly and are separated from each other, the user will not have to wonder or confuse between the options.
## 7. Recognise rather than recall: this application doesn't require user memory by limiting the number of activities present on the interface. Our interface is simple and has proper information necessary for the users.
## 8. Flexibility and Efficiency: The app works fast and gives the output in a short time , hence it is efficient to use.
## 9. Aesthetic and Minimalist design: It has a minimalist design as our interface does not contain any extra unit of information which is irrelevant or rarely used.
## 10. Help and documentation: A new page is added to displayed to present the description about the buttons.
