## HTA involves describing the task in terms of a task-subtask hierarchy and a set of plans that define in what order subtasks may be performed, or under what circumstances particular subtasks are performed at all.
## It is most suitable for analysing tasks that have a well-defined structure â€“ tasks which tend to be performed in similar ways every time, rather than those that have a very loose structure.
### Drawn below is the HTA for Handwritten Text Recognition. GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods and Selections) are utilized while Plan, Act and Do tasks are mentioned in an ordered fashion.
