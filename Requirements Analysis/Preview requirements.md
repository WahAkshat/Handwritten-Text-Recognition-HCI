## Functional Requirements (FR) define the basic interface behaviour. 
### Essentially, they are what the system does or must not do, and can be thought of in terms of how the system responds to inputs. 
### Functional requirements usually define if/then behaviours and include calculations, data input, and business processes.
### Functional requirements as FR1, FR2, and so on..... are as listed below:
#### FR1: Application should have graphical user interface. 
#### FR2: The user should upload an image file of file types â€“ .png . 
#### FR3: The output audio should be audible to the user after recognition. 
#### FR4: User should be informed during errors in the process i.e. while using the application . 
#### FR5: Input of characters with various font size and styles should recognize. 
#### FR6: Application should identify computer based English character by comparison . 
#### FR7: Application should be able for matching the stored patterns on input handwritten character. 
#### FR8: User should be able to undo/redo their actions. 
#### FR9: User should be provided with shortcuts to minimize the usage of time. 
#### FR10: User should be able to understand what each key/button represents. N11: User should be able to find help when ever needed.

## Non-functional requirements:
#### Performance: Handwritten characters in the input image will be recognised with an accuracy of about 70%.
#### Functionality: This software will deliver on the functional requirements. 
#### Availability This system will retrieve the handwritten text regions only if the image contains written text in it. 
#### Flexibility: It provides the users to load the image easily. 
#### Learning ability: The software is very easy to use and reduces the learning work.
