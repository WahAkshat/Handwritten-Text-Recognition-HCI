# Our interface has followed the following Golden rules.

## 1. Strive for consistency by applying familiar icons, colours when designing sequence of actions.
## 2. Offer information feedback by making sure the users where they are at and what is going on all time. For example, in our interface when we add a file we will be shown our image in the box below the add image option and we get the option of upload without the file getting uploaded directly.
## 3. Design dialogue to yield where users donâ€™t have to guess whether they have uploaded the right file or not. This is done by displaying the selected image in the box.
## 4. Offer simple error handling by informing the users to upload the image if they pressed the recognize option without uploading the image. The user is also show a pop up message which says that an image is not uploaded if the train option is clicked without uploading an image.
## 5. Permit easy reversal of activities by allowing the users to re-upload the right file if they have added the wrong file. The previous file will be overwritten.
## 6. Support internal locus of control by allowing the user to initiate the actions by clicking on add image option to select the desired .png image from their pc.
## 7. Reduce short-term memory load by limiting the number of activities present on the interface. Our interface is simple and has proper information necessary for the users.
## 8. Provide shortcuts to allows users to use a variety of keyboard shortcuts, for example: drag and drop along with select image option and the user can directly go back to the main page by clicking on the HomePage button in the Train Page.
